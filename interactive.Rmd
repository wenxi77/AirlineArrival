We created an interactive plot showing the quantity of delayed airlines with small circles and the more delayed airlines in this state, the more circles shown on the plot; and when the mouse put on a state, its color will change to green. When building this plot, we learned from this graph on vizhub: https://vizhub.com/itsyaboichase/3c2f7cc15fc242e4a3fb6f3dee195141?edit=files
