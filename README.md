## Project Description

This project is based on "The Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance Dataset" from IBM which contains information on approximately 200 million domestic US flights reported to the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The dataset contains basic information about each flight (such as date, time, departure airport, arrival airport) and, if applicable, the amount of time the flight was delayed and information about the reason for the delay. We will use a subset of samples(flights) to analyze the likelihood for a flight to arrive on time.
