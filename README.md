## Project Description (Group 7)

Beginning in June 2003, airlines started to report information on ariline on-time performance along with causes of delays in five broad categories: air carrier, extreme weather, national aviation system, late-arrival aircraft, and security. All these information are published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics(BTS) monthly. This project uses these information, and more specifically it is based on the "Airline On-Time Performance Data" database on the BTS websites to perform an exploratory data analysis to find underlying relationships between airline on-time performance and other factors.
